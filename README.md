# AR-APP

In this project, I will attach the materials I used along with the **.apk** file of the project for it to be used on any Android device, as well as the **.unitypackage** file for making modifications in **Unity**. The **"Pattern.png"** file is also included for creating new markers. The "markers" folder contains the markers created and used in this project. The first 15 markers have associated information, while the rest lack it.

In the *"Cables y caracter√≠sticas.xlsx"* file, you will find the information used and associated with each marker. The initial purpose was for this application to be used in networking classes. The student will use their cellphone's camera during the class, where different types of cables used in networks will be presented. This will allow the student to visually observe how each cable looks physically, while also acquiring information about their characteristics and uses through the markers.

## Showcase of the app

Below, I present a few images that provide a glimpse of the application in action. In each image, the marker in use is discreetly positioned behind the displayed text.
